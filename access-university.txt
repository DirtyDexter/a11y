2- ADA - Americans with Disability Act

Part 1- Employment
Part 2- Access to facilities and Services
Part 3- Public Accommodation
Part 4- Telecommunications


WCAG 2.0 - AA


3- Section - 508
  -Amendment in US Rehabilitation Act in 1998
  -Accessible Govt Technology - Some exception - National Security etc
  -NOT private companies

  FAR: Federal Acquisition Regulation
  ICT: Information and Communications Technology
  VPAT: Voluntary Product Accessibility Template
  GPAT: Government Product/Services Accessibility Template
  CVAA: Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act
  WCAG: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

4- Web a11y
  -Avoid Use of Before, After, Pseudo Classes for Non-Decorative Content
  -Content within these pseudo classes do not render through screen readers, with the exception of VoiceOver.
  -DO NOT DO THIS- .required:after{content:'- Required'; font-size:0.75em;}
  -Ensure the reading order of content and elements are correct when viewed without style sheets.
  -Ensure text can be resized
  -It is best to avoid the use of CSS background images that convey meaning or sensory experience.

5- keyboard Access
  - Event Handler	Alternative
    OnClick	      OnKeyPress
    OnMouseDown	  OnKeyDown
    OnMouseUp	    OnKeyUp
    OnMouseOver	  OnFocus
    OnMouseOut	  OnBlur
    OnDblClick	  OnKeyDown
  - Follow keyboard design pattern for each control
  - Keyboard Traps
  - Keyboard shortcuts
   - <input type="button" id=“btnHome" value=“Home (Accesskey: 1)" accesskey=“1“ />
   - Verify the shortcut key or accesskey does not conflict with the browser.
   - Verify that when the shortcut key or accesskey is the sole means of access it does not conflict with keystrokes commonly used by assistive technology.

6- Focus Control
  - Avoid forced focus changes that are NOT initiated by the user.
  - Make sure forced focus changes, such as an onChange or onfocus event, are not used to change context
  - Ensure revealed content receives focus.
  - When activating elements to open or display content, users expect the focus to be directed at the new content.
  - Common examples: expanded content, alerts, new table rows, additional form fields, etc.
  - If focus is not moved to the new content, users may miss critical alerts or other important pieces of information, or will have to read through entire page to find new content.
  - tabindex
  - A negative value (usually tabindex="-1") means that the element is not reachable via sequential keyboard navigation, but could be focused with JavaScript or visually by clicking with the mouse. It's mostly useful to create accessible widgets with JavaScript.
  - Note: A negative value is useful when you have off-screen content that appears on a specific event. The user won't be able to focus any element with a negative tabindex using the keyboard, but a script can do so by calling the focus() method.
  - tabindex="0" means that the element should be focusable in sequential keyboard navigation, after any positive tabindex values and its order is defined by the document's source order.

7- Embeded Media
  - Ensure embedded objects are directly accessible.
  - Video/Audio - accessible
  - Closed/Open caption
  - Text script
  - Accessible plug-in

8- Animation and Dynamic Content
  - Provide controls to pause, stop, or hide any dynamic content or animation.
  - When animated content cannot be made accessible or cannot be stepped through, provide a method to stop the animation, or provide an alternative non-animated version of the information.
  - A web page with blinking or flashing content may distract a user with a cognitive disability or low vision.
  - Elements including images that contain rapidly flashing content (content which flashes three times a second or more) may trigger epileptic seizures in individuals with photosensitive epilepsy.
  - This includes the use of flashing or blinking content in multimedia.
  - Verify that the screen size of the combined blinking elements is not greater than 3% (WCAG 2 only).


9- A11y properties and events
  - ARIA- http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php
  - Ensure appropriate ARIA roles, states and properties are used and are valid
  - Live Regions for Dynamic Content
    - Mark areas of the page that change as live regions using aria-live.
      - "polite" for areas with normal precedence
      - "assertive" for areas with urgent precedence
    - aria-labelledby
    - aria-live="off" - for regions where content updates should be ignored by assistive technology.
    - aria-describedby
    - aria-controls - points to IDREFS (a list of space-delimited references to unique document identifiers) that reference live regions that are controlled by the element
    - aria-atomic (true/false) - (use when the parts do not updated synchronously)
    - aria-relevant (additions, removals, text, all) - (Use when default relevant settings don't apply)

10- Dialog Boxes
  - Focus moves to open dialog boxes and remains in the dialog box.
  - Ensure dialog boxes indicate the beginning and end of content.
  - Ensure that simulated dialogs can be closed via the keyboard and keyboard focus returns properly from dialog boxes.
  - Ensure calendar components are accessible with the keyboard and do not rely on color or formatting.

11- WCAG-2.1
  - 17 new criteria
  - Mostly for small devices and touch screen
  - WCAG 2.0 set the foundation for color contrast minimums, but it applied solely to text. With WCAG 2.1, we’re considering color contrast of not just text but also user interface components and graphical objects. This includes things like borders of active form fields, as well as icons and graphics that convey important visual information.
  - Use 'autocomplete' attribute - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete and https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#autofill
  - Ensure that character key shortcuts without modifiers can be reconfigured or deactivated
  - Ensure that content that appears on hover or focus may be dismissed by the user
  - Ensure content that appears on hover or focus is persistent until dismissed, not valid, or the trigger is removed
  - WCAG 2.1 success criteria specifies the minimum spacing for line height, paragraphs, letters and words (1.5 times the font size, 2 times the font size, 0.12 times the font size and 0.16 times the font size, respectively)
  - Ensure pages reflow without requiring two-dimensional scrolling without loss of content or functionality
  - Ensure that content and functionality is available when the user overrides text spacing properties
  - Ensure that functionality can be operated through a single pointer except when a multi-point or path based gesture is essential
  - Ensure events triggered by single-point activation can be cancelled
  - Ensure that motion is not the only method to activate user interface components
  - Avoid restricting the operation or viewing of content in different display orientations
  - Developers need to ensure that at least one of the following is true:
    1- The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function;
    2- Completion of the function is on the up-event, and a mechanism is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion;
    3- The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event.
  - Status message- https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/status-messages.html - aria-live

12- ARIA
  - aria-labelledby
  - aria-describedby
  - Avoid outline:none
  - When using <div role="button"> for button, handle all properties of <button> like space and enter key to activate button
  - ARIA Listbox - aria-descendent
  - :focus and :hover both
  - Menubar and menuitems
  - Dialog and AlertDialog
  - Tabs - role = tablist, tab, tabpanel
  - Tables vs Grid
  - aria-required
  - aria-disabled
  - aria-invalid, use aria-describedby to associate field with error message
  - set focus to error message on submit OR use alertdialog for error with aria-live
  - Sliders - aria-valuemin, aria-valuemax, aria-valuenow, aria-valuetext, aria-orientation="horizontal"
  - Accordians - role="region", aria-controls, aria-expanded
